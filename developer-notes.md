# Developer Notes

## Setting up Sanity.io
- Kap's video was a good intro.
- Install/Create inside the repo for the actual site, etc.
- Dupe postcss config so that Sanity isn't looking for Tailwind.
- Create an `.env` file with your Sanity project ID and studio name in it for use to access data via the API.
- Learning to GROQ and expand projections: `*[_type == "post"]{author->}`
- Pull in `sanity-plugin-markdown` and put it config
- Super easy to pull in posts via query in Astro
- Use that to create some different schemas and posts in order to mock out card designs
- Create new schema entries via https://www.sanity.io/docs/

## Setting up Tailwind && Utopia
- Tinkering with different type scale to find something that fits my breakpoints in a suitable manner.

## Setting up Astro && Storybook
- Straight forward. Need JSX/React to use Storybook though :sad:.
- Gotta set up slug pages that make a request based on the slug or ID of the sanity post? Should be slug. But that feels a little brittle for some reason...

## TODO::
- Sort out the pinned posts sorting
- Social footer icons [ Mastodon, Twitter, Instagram, etc. from current ]
- Create links page
- Testimonial tabs
- Post pagination via URL
- Use Hero Icons
