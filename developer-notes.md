# Developer Notes

## Setting up Sanity.io
- Kap's video was a good intro.
- Install/Create inside the repo for the actual site, etc.
- Dupe postcss config so that Sanity isn't looking for Tailwind.
- Create an `.env` file with your Sanity project ID and studio name in it for use to access data via the API.
- Learning to GROQ and expand projections: `*[_type == "post"]{author->}`
- Pull in `sanity-plugin-markdown` and put it config
- Super easy to pull in posts via query in Astro
- Use that to create some different schemas and posts in order to mock out card designs
- Create new schema entries via https://www.sanity.io/docs/

## Setting up Tailwind && Utopia
- Tinkering with different type scale to find something that fits my breakpoints in a suitable manner.

## Setting up Astro && Storybook
- Straight forward. Need JSX/React to use Storybook though :sad:.
- Gotta set up slug pages that make a request based on the slug or ID of the sanity post? Should be slug. But that feels a little brittle for some reason...

## Astro and RSS is a PitA if you have Markdown on a CMS...
- Do it with Node???
- Trick is to use something like posts.xml.js but use ReactDom and React.createElement to reuse your other Markdown processing techniques...
- Use the sanitizer to make things happy
- Go through the spec
- Check against a validator
- Remove all the garbage people don't need â€“ We can't assume everyone uses Feedly

## DONE::
- ~~Social footer icons [ Mastodon, Twitter, Instagram, etc. from current ]~~
- Use Hero Icons
- Fix sizing scales for fonts etc. Need step-0 to be around 14px not --1. Could we use prose plugin for blog posts?
- posts/[page]
- posts/[topic]/[page]
- / === posts/
- post/[slug]
- Pagination Component
- Lazy load a banner demo iframe...
- Fix up and remove spacing properties from Tailwind..
- Way to differentiate between ContentBlock in post/article? Pass a "type" prop into the Card and use exception objects for the components map
- Dropping an embed iframe into CodePen and then styling that as a private pen and linking it via the theme. Grab the theme ID from the embed generator
- Export/Import dataset data with Sanity CLI... Why don't ENV variables work with the CLI config???
- Filter details/view by categories... [Backburner... Think about where this could even fit in?]
- Fix the horizontal padding...
- Fix the font weights being pulled
- Cards
- Tags by relation
- Banner backup image for motion...
- Set up SEO for each page inside Sanity - Meta Descriptions in schema and fix title inside Layout
- Post footers...
- RSS 
- Card Status/Pinned
- Sort out the pinned posts sorting
- Refactor and keep all your queries in one place to make your life easier
- Links
- Using the multi-purpose <ContentBlock/>
- Had issues after a machine upgrade with `storybook`. But, this gave me the opp to try the Vite builder `npx sb@next upgrade --prerelease`
- Persona authors for the different tag pages... Define a specialty. Make those topic pages discoverable.
- Tabs

## TODO::
- Deploy CMS
- Pages
  - about - Include sig and some way to show demos?
  - 404
  - Guestbook
  - Testimonials
- Timeline items [ Article, Newsletter feature, YouTube appearance, Life thing, Random Misc, Smashing person of week, Did a thing, etc. Drop an icon type if needed that can be mapped? ]

- Edge functions for "New items in feed?"
- Skewed gradient stinger from Auto Alex
- Web Mentions?
- Serverless likes with Xata
- Serverless hit counter?
- Roll your own image optimisation with Sharp like you did on jhey.dev
